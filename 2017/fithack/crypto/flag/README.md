# Crypto - Flag

### Description

> why can't unzip!!

### Attachments

[flag.zip](flag.zip)

### Solution

When examined, the zip file is password protected. Putting it through a zipfile
password cracker (I used Parallel Recovery's Zip Password Recovery) reveals that
the password is a 4-digit number, `1864`. Extracting the zip archive gives a
single file, `flag/flag.txt`.
